Hey there, I’m Amanda. I’m a product designer currently based in San Francisco. My background is in visual art and I worked in the non-profit world for nearly a decade before focusing on design. Both past lives have served me well and contribute to my design goal to create user-centered experiences that are intuitive and delightful. I’m no stranger to research, strategy, problem-solving, and bringing people with different perspectives together to move a project forward. I’m well-practiced at keeping the bigger picture in mind while being attentive to the details. I enjoy turning on some jams, brewing up a cup of tea, and putting ideas onto the page (or screen).
