        <h1>TROVE</h1>
        <p>Trove came from the idea that there should be one place to hold everything you need, available on any device. <b>Trove is for users and collaborators that want to quickly organize and find notes, images, and links.</b>
        <br><br>
        Trove is the first project I completed during design bootcamp. I kept the goals of the original project, named “blocbox,” and took it a step further by creating a new name, logo, and layout. Competitive analysis, user surveys, and user interviews all contributed to trove’s structure and design. I carried out user testing on wireframes and then prototypes to hone in on a responsive interface that met project goals as well as user needs.</p>

        <p>A <b>competitive analysis</b> showed an opportunity for trove to: be built for both individuals and teams, serve as a repository for all content types, and offer external collaboration for lower, approachable pricing tiers. <b>User research</b> showed trove should focus on responsive design and include the ability to save notes and web content.
        <br><br>
        Three <b>personas</b> represent trove users. Susan saves tons of content on her phone during her commute and gets overwhelmed when sorting through it later. Kevin is always on the computer and is comfortable trying new apps but he’s still searching for the right one to keep both work and personal life organized. Brenda often writes notes for herself and saves links. She is looking for one simple place to store everything so it doesn’t go forgotten.</p>
