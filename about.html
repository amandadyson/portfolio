          <p><b>Hey there, I’m Amanda. I’m a product designer based in San Francisco.</b> My background is in visual art and I worked in the non-profit world for nearly a decade before focusing on design. Both past lives have served me well and contribute to my design goal to create user-centered experiences that are intuitive and delightful. I’m no stranger to research, strategy, problem-solving, and bringing people with different perspectives together to move a project forward. I’m well-practiced at keeping the bigger picture in mind while being attentive to the little details. I enjoy turning on some jams, brewing up a cup of tea, and putting ideas onto the page (or screen).</p>

          <h3>THE EARLY YEARS</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-left foo">
          <p>My creative streak started early. I was introduced to the Commodore 64 at age two and quickly became a forever lover of video games. On career day in first grade I dressed as an artist. In the 90s, I remember spending hours on the perfect gif placement for my GeoCities page. From there, I moved on to directing and editing music videos and short films with friends and family members.</p>

        <div class="timeline-right foo">
          <h3>BA Studio Art & English Literature | MA Cultural Policy & Arts Management</h3>
          <p>My education gave me a solid foundation in the visual arts and a unique business perspective that I rely on for design projects. It also gave me practice in talking about my work and listening to feedback. Pursuing my MA in Ireland gave me the opportunity to work collaboratively with an internationally diverse group of peers and mentors. This experience shaped the way I approach problems and conduct research.</p>

          <h3>Internships with The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum & SITE Santa Fe</h3>
          <p>Museum internships combined visual art and business for me in a more concrete way. I discovered  that I was interested in the way museums communicated with their many stakeholders. I also found that I loved being assigned projects that required creating a nice looking layout with images and text.</p>

          <h3>Non-Profits in Austin & San Francisco</h3>
          <p>From 2010 to 2017, I worked on non-profit development and marketing teams. The mission-driven work kept me motivated. I sharpened skills that now inform my approach to design: project management, collaborating with teams, carrying out research, utilizing data, building relationships, and cultivating empathy. Over the years, my professional development goals became directed toward boosting my design chops. After talking with friends about how I was looking for something new, I realized user experience design was a career path that combined my love of visual arts and design, problem-solving, and meeting the needs of people.</p>

          <h3>Bloc Design Apprenticeship & Internship</h3>
          <p>Making a career change took commitment but it’s one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I chose Bloc’s Design Program because it offered the most comprehensive curriculum, regular 1:1 mentorship, and front-end development learning. I spent more time sketching and translating ideas into pixels than I ever thought possible (hello iterative design) and enjoyed (pretty much) every minute. I also realized that it’s not a huge leap to go from non-profit donor advocate to user advocate.</p>
