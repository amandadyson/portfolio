        <h1>HABIT</h1>
        <p>Habit presented itself as a project from conversations with friends about the time and money we spend on apps - often the ones we open and close to take a peek at many times throughout the day, without even realizing it. What if there was an easy way to check on those habits, set goals, and be more mindful? <b>Habit is for anyone looking to save time and money, or wanting to cut back on phone use for any reason (including because you just read that article on why boredom is good for you).</b></p>

        <p>It’s safe to say that most of us habitually check our phones for alerts, for browsing social media, and everything in between. That screen time adds up, and many of us are seeking out ways to be more mindful. Habit was created to be a non-intrusive solution for anyone looking to track their app use.</p>

        <h3>SOLUTION</h3>

      <div class="solution-text">
        <p>Results from user research and competitive analysis show an opportunity for Habit. Habit should offer the ability to customize which apps are tracked, indicate number of app opens, and show total amount spent within apps (such as food delivery or rideshare services). Users will use Habit to achieve a variety of goals - from spending less time on social media to maintaining boundaries or saving money. Because of this, the design and experience of Habit should be welcoming and simplistic so users can quickly customize the app based on their desired outcome.</p>

        <p>Habit is a personal project I led from start to finish with guidance from a mentor. After the initial idea was concepted, I began with completing a competitive SWOT analysis and gathering data through a user survey. This research showed an opportunity for Habit, so I moved forward in developing  user personas, the foundation of the app’s design and features.</p>

        <p>Users had a variety of goals they wanted to achieve: being mindful of time spent on social media throughout the day, maintaining current boundaries, and being attentive to money spent on apps. When creating user stories, each goal was given attention and incorporated into the design. User flows also reflected these goals, and outlined a structure for users to easily navigate the app.</p>
